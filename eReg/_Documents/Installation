Notes 12/10/2016
================

scanAndSet receives garbage so does not identify spi_bigrealay
probably a speed problem

Interfaces.c : scanAndSet modified to just do a return

Note that Interfaces.o and libInterfaces.so was in git, so would overwrite any new compilation.
Modified to just exit.

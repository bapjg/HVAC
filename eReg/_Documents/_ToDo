Mixer
=====
	Measure dT/dt at Boiler and Mixer_Hot.
	Keep in mind dT/dt at Mixer_Hot depends on valve openning (especially if Boiler is Hot)
	Look at OverShoot while running
	Thread_Mixer.stopNow continuation variable implemented. Use it in mixer.sequencer()
	Put in Global

Thread_Mixer
============
	Introduce the notion of wait having occured in one of the method calls
	Should there not be another thread
	Re-acrchitect Circuit.sequencer() ???
	Introduce a ThreadVariable .stop
	Big dT deterministic approach (like now)
	Small dT delta approach.
	
	Try swing = K x deltaTemp
		
EnergyRequirements
==================
	Use null instead of -1
	
singleCircuitActive
===================
	Boolean Circuits.singleCircuitActive() implemnted but reports 3 activeCircuits instead of 2 Wtare+Floor
	Use it inCircuit.sequencer().
	
Hot Water
=========
	Find out dT(HotWater)/dT(Boiler) to optimise
	Use SingleCircuit
	Create button to activate
	
Statistics
==========
	Create Headings at startup

Thermometers
============
	Create thermal contact
	Calibrate Trip (heat and see at what temp the pump trips
	
Linux
=====
	fstab

	Wrong Friday was treated as Saturday

Radiator/Mixer
==============
	Use TemperatureGradient	

Thermometers
============
	Calibrate : Ok to 1 degree
			

Circuit
=======
	Introduce subClasses
